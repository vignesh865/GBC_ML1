Been to a few other locations before this one and definitely don't feel any difference between them. They all are uniform and great.We wanted a night out just to enjoy some meats but didn't want to cook at home.Came here around 5pm before the crowd and got seated immediately.They were always on top of everything throughout the entire time we were there, clearing our tables as dishes became empty and making sure we were happy.There was moderate noise in there with other people grilling and chatting.",5 star rating

Food selection for dinner $42: Beef: average Pork: average Chicken: average Lamb: n/a (it would be nice to have it )Fish: only has salmon. (Adding a tilapia white fish would be nice) Shrimp: good (it would be nice to have Tiger shrimp for dinner menu or scallops) Customer service : 1. Reservation policy: I tried to make a reservation for 4 and but was told that they don't accept party below 6 . I witnessed that the person reserved for 7 but showed up saying only 5 . The host let them in. So if that's the case, we can all make reservations for 7 people but show up as 5 or 4.  Recommendation: let people make reservations regardless the party size with 10 minutes windows.2. Washroom : clean 3. The waitress is very attentive to change mesh and plate. Overall: I would recommend to have friends gathering and family events.",4 star rating

Service was prompt and courteous, for a smaller restaurant they are pretty efficient. Great for groups, casual dates and families. Place is very clean, which is huge for me, you can tell the restaurant is ran well.Highly recommend!",5 star rating

I joined the list at 4:30 and we didn't get the table until 6:20. We waited at home and the time changed twice, so that was annoying but we eventually got the table. Service was fast and the food was great. We tried pretty much all the meats and veggies and liked the shrimp, chicken thigh, and short rib the best.",4 star rating

The dinner includes a lot more variety relative to the lunch. We ordered 2 servings of prime kalbi (it was that good), black pepper kalbi, miso beef brisket, Kurobuta sausages, sake clam, pork belly and salmon for the meats/seafood. I would highly recommend the prime Kalbi :) It was perfectly marbled and thinly sliced to pick up lots of flavour from the sauce. I also really enjoyed the sake clam, it had a light savoury flavour. We also had some lettuce on the side to go with the meat. Their mushrooms were also great. I would recommend getting a bibimbap or cold noodles to go with the meal. Overall great dining experience! The only downside is the lineup system is a bit unorganized resulting in long wait times even after they said tables are ready.",4 star rating

Heard great reviews but every time I go there it's a 3 hours + wait time!! Today I got there at 5pm and didn't get a table until close to 8pm. I took 1 star off for the wait time. There has to be a more efficient way to get atable. It's a 2 hour time limit and it's also a all you can eat place.  For $40 pp adult price on the weekends I think it's fair. There's a variety of meat from beef, chicken, pork and seafood. There's lots of sides and vegetables to choose from. For desserts there's a crèmeBrûlée which was quite tasty and a fruit popsicles. Having been to a a la carte bbq place I would say the cut of meat is not the best quality but it wasn't bad.Tip: You can log into yelp and join waitlist before you getTo the restaurant. It's pretty cool you can see the live waitlist and see where you are in line as well as the wait times for all the restaurants. Great function which I didn't know and went to the restaurant to be added to the waitlist and had to keep my kids busy for 3 hours. Weekends and holidays are crazy I would suggest going on weeknights and it's a bit cheaper.I would come back but would join the virtual waitlist first. It's pretty good for an all you can eat lots of variety. I have to say the service was amazing. Our server was always nearby to get us whatever we need. Beware there's additional charge for any food you can't finish so only order what you can eat!They only take cash to or debit card. No credit card.",4 star rating

Parking is way better in this location compared to the downtown area. The servers are friendly and attentive. Atmosphere is good, bring the fam. Food is great, well seasoned and it's AYCE, just remember they only give you a 2 hour window to cook and enjoy your food.",4 star rating

Wanted to check them out as other fellow yelpers have ranted about this place. so I took a detour to stop by on my way to view the city. I ended up placing an order for pick up so I wouldn't have to stop in to eat while touring the city, Food was ready upon pick up and included utensils and napkins inside. I ended up getting the carbonara and the brick cheese plates. I think I enjoyed and loved the brick cheese ones much more than the carbonara one. The carbonara sauce was lacking in just about everything if you ask me. There was no taste, just a cream sauce, no cheese or nothing! Make sure to get the cheese bricks if you do not know what to get. Staff was friendly and had everything ready for me when I got there. They also let me use the restroom after I paid. DEF a fan and will be coming back for some grub each visit to the 6!",4 star rating
13,https://www.yelp.ca/biz/katsuya-mississauga-4?osq=Restaurants,Katsuya,184 reviews,Ashley N.,"Came in on a Monday around 5:30pm to catch up with a friend. We were seated right away because it was almost empty. Server was great with us and fairly attentive. We ended up staying for about 3 hours and they never pushed us to leave once, even though we were just 2 people at a four person table. It got busier throughout the night, but the servers were so nice. Food was great! I got a pork katsu with the Japanese style sauce. Very crispy breading and juicy meat. I feel like there could've been a little more sauce on the side, just because I found there wasn't enough for the amount of meat I had. The sauce was tangy and sweet, a great complement to the chicken and sesame seeds.Restaurant was clean and well lit. The back wall is a rich, dark colour which helps keep a modern and sleek appearance.",4 star rating
14,https://www.yelp.ca/biz/katsuya-mississauga-4?osq=Restaurants,Katsuya,184 reviews,Courtney C.,"I love this place! A total bang for your bucks! I got their carbonara chicken Katsu and their Japanese pork katsu. The Japanese sauce is average and taste very much like BBQ sauce, nonetheless still very delicious, but the carbonara sauce is to die for! This is definitely my favourite item on their menu. It's super flakey and crispy on the outside mixed in with their creamy carbonara sauce. 5/5I also tried their red carbonara udon! Super saucy, super creamy with a kick! I wished it came with chicken/pork katsu instead of shrimp but still super delicious. 4/5 Lastly, we got the sliver brick cheese katsu. For all you pork and cheese lover out there, this one is for you! 3.5/5",5 star rating

After grabbing a table with rickety, uncomfortable stools, I began perusing their surprisingly extensive menu. I finally decided to go with the Garlic Spicy Katsu (""Spicy katsu complemented with deep-fried fresh garlic"") and I got that with the Pork Loin Katsu option.It arrived a little while later and it looked amazing. I mean, it's fried meat and plentiful gravy. What's not to like?This is one tasty dish. The pork loin was cooked perfectly and was impressively tender, while the curry sauce and the plentiful garlic enhanced the pork considerably. The other components, including rice and a lightly dressed cabbage salad, work well, too.I guess my only complaint would be that the sauce was just a touch sweeter than I would've preferred. I'm not sure why any sugar was added to this but it definitely doesn't need it.I'm excited to come back and try some of their many other variations, that's for sure.",5 star rating
17,https://www.yelp.ca/biz/katsuya-mississauga-4?osq=Restaurants,Katsuya,184 reviews,Stephanie S.,"Review is for takeout!-10% for cash payments, -15% if you're in Markham/North York/Downtown!!!This place is pretty much down the street from my house, but the last time that I visited was a few years ago.  No reason for the delay, but I guess we all overlook places that are close-by!Obviously, not the same experience as I got a takeout, so I'm not even sure if they still offer all-you-can-eat/drink miso soup / shredded cabbage salad for dine-in.  All I know is that they did not serve miso soup due to some ""disruption in supply chain"", but they offered udon soup instead.Certainly, not cheap, but the sauces are GOOD!  And sauces/choice of protein is basically the difference between all the offerings.  You get to choose pork/chicken/fish, then whatever flavour of sauce that you feel like.I ordered the Red Carbonara and it really hit the spot with a nice combo of creamy, tangy, and SPICY.  Yes, there was definitely some heat to it!If you get takeout, eat dish is served in a bento box style takeout container.  There is a separate container for the sauce so your katsu doesn't get soggy and it's more than enough sauce.  The entire bento is a nice, balanced meal - good enough serving for 1 without feeling overstuff...or hungry.Best to order ahead!",4 star rating
18,https://www.yelp.ca/biz/katsuya-mississauga-4?osq=Restaurants,Katsuya,184 reviews,Tiffany C.,"Ordered takeout via uber.Curry was nice and sweet, thick sauce as anticipated with Japanese curries.Pork katsu was well battered and fried. unfortunately was already a bit soggy when I ate it given I couldn't eat it right away and it was delivery. Overall pork was not tough and not dry. One katsu, average size portion. Comes with a few pickled Daikon, Shredded cabbage, and sauce. Overall good sides for your katsu. Miso soup was nice and clean. Good way to cleanse the palate.Overall good quality. Wish i had it fresh so cant gauge when it was crispy, however given I ate it after hours and still kept a good texture and consistency, I can imagine it being very good on arrival!Would love to dine in.",4 star rating

Their sister restaurant which is an attached ramen place didn't have a wait at all lol. They don't take reservations so you have to walk-in and join their digital waitlist. They will text you when your table is ready so you can do other stuff while you wait.Our server, Harry, was really great! He gave great recommendations and was able to tell us how many pieces were in each order. He was very attentive and it was really easy to catch his eye to put in another order. This is important since you have a 2 hour seating limit.Unlike other Japanese AYCE places, they have a lot of side dishes like poke bowls and sushi/maki for order as well! We tried the Takumi signature roll which has cooked beef and even apple in it.Our favourites of the cook-your-own meats were:1. Definitely the rib-eye which was a thicker cut and limited to 2 pieces per guest, 2. Marinated lamb which was thin cut but tasty and cooked quickly, and 3. The sake marinated clams which come in a foil dish for to steam over the grill.",5 star rating
21,https://www.yelp.ca/biz/takumi-bbq-and-ramen-mississauga?osq=Restaurants,Takumi BBQ and Ramen,69 reviews,Sehar A.,"Been on my list of places to try for a looong time.Verdict: it's now been permanently removed from my listThey have a wait list which you have to fill out IN PERSON. So once you arrive, your wait time begins. They don't take reservations or have a virtual wait list which you can join ahead of time.The service was great (once seated), but the food was terrible. There were no seasonings or marinades.Even the ones that are supposed to marinated were bland and lacked any flavour.They also don't have ssamjang or anything to use. They provide salt, pepper, and some green onions if you order the raw meat...and 3 sauces at the table (bbq sauce, bbq dipping liquid, and ponzu) ... but even then, it's extremely bland.I'm seriously doubting all the positive reviews for this place..and if they were from legitimate customers. If they WERE real customers and being honest... they need to try better places lol because if this is ""the best you've ever had""...then I feel very sorry for you lol. Honestly, one can easily buy meat and cook it and it would have been a fraction of the price. I honestly feel like I wasted over $140 for something I could have easily elevated on my own (which I DID ...at the table attempting to make it somewhat edible). All the reviews from people saying 'stop waiting in line for gyubee'...etc clearly haven't tried the food worth having, or may not have cooked it the correct way, but either way...I will ABSOLUTELY wait in line for Gyubee any day! Every single time!Unfortunately I dont think I'll be returning or recommending this place to a single personDefinitely NOT Worth the price.",1 star rating

The flavors were so good that my taste buds did a happy dance, especially when I slurped up their delicious ramen and BBQ steak. Now, let's talk about the elephant in the room - it's a tad on the pricey side, but hey, good food is worth the occasional wallet workout. Over $20 for a 4year old kid is a lot. So, if you're ready to treat yourself and your taste buds to some culinary delight, this place is where it's at!Service was pleasant and quick.",4 star rating

There's amazing sides that include sushi, Korean noodles, dessert, etc. my friend and I didn't focus on the side dishes as much so we could eat the meat but the appetizers were plentiful.  The quality of the meat was superb, the service was efficient, and the ambiance of the restaurant was fun and exciting. My friend and I came around 6 pm on a weekday and were seated right away. Do note that there's a set price for the AYCE for Monday - Thursday. The Friday - Sunday price is more expensive. Standouts for me were the sake clams, the garlic shrimp, brisket, taro melona, and the sushi. There's plenty of parking around the area and it's free. I would definitely recommend giving this place a try when you're in the area.",5 star rating
25,https://www.yelp.ca/biz/takumi-bbq-and-ramen-mississauga?osq=Restaurants,Takumi BBQ and Ramen,69 reviews,Michelle K.,"I would definitely consider this place one of the better ayce options in Mississauga. My friends and I came at around 5:45 on a weekday and plenty of seats left. They do not take reservations, so I usually try to go earlier to be seated right away. For our first round, we pretty much ordered all of the beef and pork options along with some appetizers. The food came out all in one round and filled up the whole table. They also have a limit of 2 pieces of ribeye, but the pieces are massive! We had to cut it using scissors provided. I did find some of the marinated meats a bit salty, but my friend seemed to like it so more of a personal preference.Standout dishes: pork cheeks (had a good fat ratio and didn't take long to cook), cheesy mussels (drool... so good), sake calms, and the thick cut pork belly. The service was also very good. The staff came by to change our grill 3 times without us having to flag them down. They also were quite attentive at removing our dishes from the table once we were done. They also did let us know that we were approaching the 2 hour dining limit by giving us a chance to do last call orders.Overall, it is a great place to hang out with friends and do ayce. They also have a great variety of food options that are not meat, so everyone can find something that they like. They do change up the desserts they have. When I went, only the yuzu creme Brulee was available, as well as strawberry/melon melona.",5 star rating

27,https://www.yelp.ca/biz/takumi-bbq-and-ramen-mississauga?osq=Restaurants,Takumi BBQ and Ramen,69 reviews,Kevin C.,"I had doubts about Takumi because they have a big menu - JBBQ, ramen, sushi, everyone's favourite Japanese foods all in one place? It is difficult to maintain a large menu without compromising quality. But I am glad I finally tried this as it did not disappoint. Meat was marinated well and tender, while seafood and veggies were fresh. The servers waste no time in bringing the food to you and we had a great feast.People will compare this to Gyubee as they are around the same price range and are direct competitors. In a way, I like Takumi more as they have more food options that I can grill on, especially seafood. The appetizers are great too for those that do not want to focus on meat, such as Sushi, Bibimbap or Takoyaki. Each round of ordering allowed me to try something new and there were still many things I did not try by the time I got full. Maybe next time.My experience reflects their ""dinner menu"". Also, lines can be long, so come early.Overall, this would become my go-to JBBQ place in Mississauga.",5 star rating

Was here for All you can eat dinner menu which had a great selection of beef, pork, chicken, various seafood and vegetables. I would highly recommend any of the beef and thin sliced pork belly. The oyster mushrooms was also amazing with the sauce they provided. I was presently surprised by their sushi! We tried all 4 types and they were all amazing :) I would say the only downside is the limited 2 hour seating time. The price was pretty reasonable at around $50/person after tax.

This place attracts a diverse crowd and I've used it for everything from dates to nights out with the boys. You could take your mom or dad here if they were cool, but maybe grandma and grandpa might not appreciate it as much -- too hip for them I'd say. Take them to Snug Harbour for overhyped seafood nearby instead!I'd go here more often if it wasn't so out of the way for me living in the northern part of Mississauga.

I came with the family who ordered burgers and chicken and waffles....they were satisfied.Hubby had the spinach salad and thought it was fine.  The only item on the menu I could have was the spinach salad without the cheese. It was basically a big bowl of spinach and dressing with some red onions and stale walnuts in it.

Some made sense- others i was confused. Their biscuits were amazing and the mac and cheese was pretty good as well.  3/5Service- I dont know what we did to annoy Kasia other then be a large group (all couples in our 30's) but from the get-go her attention was really hard to get. I felt like we were an obstacle in the way of ending her night. However Kasia did assist in getting us beverages and taking our order and getting us food. She did conveniently forget to mention that they had run out of brisket before hand- and halfway thru a table of 10 ordering is when that update had come. Come on Kasia- that is one of your most popular dishes! you dont think a heads up would be good? Anyways its not her fault or problem that brisket is out right. So we order our food and enjoy the rest of the evening and when it comes to pay. We discover that Kasia also left out another piece of information- that our bills will have auto gratuity of 20%. So every body double tipped. 40% tip. Nice job Kasia? i guess -1/5,2 star rating

In search of a patio on a hot day, we got right in. Nicole, our server was wonderful. Always quick with refills, food was out soon after we ordered, and she was very attentive.Being from Buffalo, I am extremely critical of wings. I saw the smoked wings on the menu and decided to try them out. They were great. The honey hot option came with two dipping sauces that offered both a sweet and smokey taste.For entrees, the Peri Peri chicken was more than enough. Delicious mashed potatoes and plentiful pickles (the best part!) The burger was juicy and a great option. I tend to like a crispier fry, so that was my only issue, however they did have good flavor.

And I loved the breading it was flavorful and had a little kick to it. The wings, somehow we got a whole drumstick lol they were good. The seafood stuffed medallions has a nice creamy sauce note that the medallions have trout stuffed in them so if you don't like trout you may want to skip this dish. Lastly the odb chicken that is served in a bucket over thier thyme fries which is a mixture of regular and sweet potatoes. The chicken was really hot temperature wise and juicy but I found that thereWas WAY to much breading and the breading was salty I took a lot of it off  the pieces of chicken are quite large this meal can feed 2 people.  The gravy tasted like banquet hall gravy lol and the fries were not good and I notice other tables not eating thier fries as well.Overall I do see potential and room for growth if I was in the area again I would be open to giving them another chance. I would probably go for the smoked bbq options next time.",3 star rating

I've heard about this place before, and have been meaning to check it out for some time now. Must I say, this place is AMAZINGGG. I loved every aspect of my experience here. I came to Door FiftyFive on a snowy-blizzardy night, and the only thing I found difficult was the parking. Food- I ordered the platter (as it states it easily feeds two). This ""Boss"" Platter (~$55) included Buttermilk Chicken (2pc.) with amazing gravy, Nachos & Chili, Sausage, Beef, Ribs (8 rack)... if I'm forgetting something... it's probably because I was distracted by the abundance of flavours going on in my mouth (haha!)... no really, it was that good. Everything on that platter was excellent. I was trying to find something to criticize, but for the most part it was amazing. HIGHLY HIGHLY recommend. Also bought a bottle of Malbec on the side ~$29. Service- Excellent. Was very attentive to our table. No complaints. Polite, friendly, and funny! Live music playing in the background. Acoustics! (Such a great atmosphere!!!)Parking- Hard to find. Usually parallel to the side of the street. MUST TRY!",5 star rating

Now let me start off by saying that I hate grits; but I was always curious about the combination of shrimp and grits, especially since they're popular in the South. I LOVE Southern cooking, so I was willing to put aside my previous experience with grits to try something new. Very laid back atmosphere; come in and seat yourself then the waiters in baseball shirts and caps will come along and take your order. Interesting mix of people: business people in suits, Goth girls, and regulars in plaid shirts and jeans. The live music was LOUD so we opted to sit farthest away from the stage. The guitarist was pretty good playing a variety of music from county,  rock and I even heard one of the songs from the movie Breakfast Club.HUBBY AND I SHARED:- Blackened Shrimp and Gumbo (tomato broth) Cheddar Grits which also came with mussels. The mussels were briny (bleh) but tender, the shrimp were meaty but not as fresh as I would like (Hey I'm from Socal) but the grits turned my world upside down! It was love at first bite OH MY MY MY! I would have never imagined that I would be a fan of savoury grits.- The Capone Brisket Sandwich came with a mix of sweet potato and regular potato fries with a side of delicious Smoked Horseradish Alabama Sauce. The brisket was piled high but the meat was on the dry side. It was missing the Jack Daniel's bbq sauce, so I used the sauce that came with the fries. The sandwich combined with sauce had good flavor.  Lots of delicious sounding items on the menu, great atmosphere and a cool mix of people. Whether you come to drink or not, you'll have a good time.",4 star rating

The tomato jam and sriracha mayo added a spicy, tangy kick to each bite. The thick slice of white cheddar balanced the toppings well. The fluffy, seasoned bun did a wonderful job of holding everything together.The fries were crispy and salty, and paired well with the sweet house ketchup.

The interior is totally different from other Viet estaurants; they have many plants and a blossom tree , giving it a true Vietnamese vibe.  Apparently we wanted to try the pho suon bo xi quach, which is the pork bone noodle soup, but they had already sold out by 1 pm. So, I ordered the special Bun Bo Hue, which is only available from Friday to Sunday. It is the best Bun Bo Hue I've ever had. They served beef, crab cake, homemade sausage, and ham hock. I particularly enjoyed their crab cake and homemade sausage, as they were filled with many ingredients. The soup broth was absolutely flavorful and delicious. We also tried their special rice noodle soup, which is pho and it served with various meats and delicious soup too. All of their portions are huge and I couldn't finish it all, so I saved some for another meal. Also, they have side toppings on each table, including different kinds of chili peppers and garlic. While it's slightly more expensive than some other Viet restaurants, the quality is worth it! I'd definitely go back again.",5 star rating

The restaurant is super busy so expect to wait in line. Luckily I know the owner so he squeezed me through the crowd to sit first. It doesn't matter what time you go as it is continually busy from open to close. However the wait isn't too long as many people eat and leave. The restaurant was very spacious and beautiful with Vietnamese inspired decor all around the place. The cashier walls were painted with a beautiful mural of ladies in traditional áo dài while the side wall was decorated with commissioned paintings from Vietnam. For a very busy restaurant, it was very clean unlike most Vietnamese restaurants. Pho Anh Vũ franchise is very well known for its pho dishes. Oh boy, that might have been the best tasting pho my fiancé has eaten so far.. tender meat and very rich broth too.

I love Viet food so it was nice to finally try it with friends. They have an iPad waiting system in place and we were lucky that for a table of 8, we were seated in about 5 mins for a busy, late, Sunday lunch. It was definitely packed!!! The decor was quite interesting, especially the four canvases of Vietnam. For such a place, I was surprised that there's only one female washroom. Servers' English competency weren't the greatest even though they look young. They had trouble answering some of our questions. The meals did not come together, but spread out within 10-15 mins from the first dish. My chicken vermicelli had more meat then expected. The flavour was there, for $17. More pickled carrots would be nice!! Everyone appeared to enjoy the food. I would go back to try their other dishes, perhaps on a weekday when it's less busy.",4 star rating

The food was very flavourful (the broth on the Pho Dac Biet and the Bun Bo Hue were both chef's kiss). The pho had a good amount of toppings and the beef was very tender. The chicken wing appetizer had a good balance of fish sauce, sweetness, and garlic that melded well. There were a few items on the menu we wanted to try but they were on specific dates/times, so will definitely be back next time (the number 22 Pho in particular with the big bone is only available from 11:30am-2 pm and the Bun Rieu is only available on Thursday).",5 star rating

Their menu is a la carte and you grill the meat yourself. It comes with refillable steamed egg, cheese corn, and kimchi on the sides of the grill. It also comes with a complementary soybean soup and refillable side dishes (mashed potato/pumpkin, acorn jelly, spicy beansprouts, and etc). I think the mashed potato/pumpkin is their best side dish. The recipe for the soup around 2 years ago was the best imo and the reason I came back so many times (to the point where the servers noticed and welcomed us back lmao). The soup now is still good but for some reason it doesn't taste the same as before.You can also order extra side dishes like seafood pancake, squid salad, cold noodles, and more. The seafood pancake tasted a bit undercooked (but that may be how it's supposed to be made?). The squid salad is very spicy, but very good. They add apple slices which surprisingly works very well with the dish. You need to order a minimum of 2 meats which, unlike Gyubee, aren't marinated but I prefer it that way. Instead they give you an onion dipping sauce and 2 other dipping sauces (forgot the name).

There are a lot of eateries and places to get drinks here so I was really surprised that we were able to get parking pretty easily at dinner time. There were some tables that were available around 7:30pm on a Saturday so we didn't have to wait.The menus are accessible via QR code on the table. Daldongnae is a la carte but their meats are really high quality so it's worth the premium. All of the cuts of beef are great. The banchans and grill accompaniments are all refillable, which is great because the egg is realllly good! We always get the kimchi fried rice and seafood pancake as sides. The former is spicy and if you want to tone it down a bit, I recommend getting cheese added to it. My group also loves to add the extra egg to the fried rice. The fried rice comes with one sunny side up egg but with the additional egg, we all get a good portion.The service is really good here. They're very prompt with the refills of the sides and water. There's also just a lot of staff always walking around so it's easy to flag someone down and it doesn't have to be your server.Daldongnae still my go-to KBBQ spot!",5 star rating

Located in Mississauga's historic Chinatown centre, it has an end unit with a large dining room and patio. My party of 6 arrived on a Friday night at 7:30pm without reservations, and I was happy (and lucky) to get a table in 20 minutes - even though the line was long!The service was FAST. Occasionally servers forgot to bring what we asked for, but we eventually got help and it was fine. They were just so busy. So be decisive and try to order what you need before you run out. Food came out pretty fast. Our table has 2 grills. We really enjoyed all the banchan and main dishes. Would definitely come back again to try more from their extensive menu!",5 star rating

They have multiple locations throughout the GTA. Each table is equipped with a built-in grill where you can cook a variety of meats to perfection. From marinated beef and pork to succulent chicken and seafood, the menu offers an extensive selection of high-quality cuts that are seasoned to enhance their natural flavors.The bonus for me is their unlimited cheese corn and egg. Can't get enough!!",5 star rating

Downsides: You have to grill yourself and their meats are all in marinated. They also require you to order two meats per table. It comes with a decent number of side dishes and the corn cheese is delicious. The cold noodle salad was not what I was expecting but portion size was large,4 star rating

The inside of the restaurant is very aesthetically pleasing and it's kept at a cool temperature which helps a lot once you start cooking. The beef that we ordered was a little bit dry and had absolutely no flavour, so you really have to rely on the side dishes for that. The service was good, very helpful but didn't really check in so it was kind of hard to ask questions if needed.",4 star rating

At first we thought the à la carte menu was kinda pricey but it's actually so affordable when split between two people. The sides can can be refilled for free. We were full afterwards and the food tasted great. For food we ordered:Thin Sliced Pork Belly $18.99- There were many slices in the portion as long as you break themapart. Very yummy Beef Rib Finger Meat $22.99- small thick pieces of beef that was cooked tender and juicyKimchi Fried Rice with Pork $14.99-came with a fried egg on top and was delicious. There weren't a lot of pork pieces though The BBQ came with eggs, corn cheese, garlic and kimchi which can be refilled along with the side dishes. It also came with a free kimchi soup! The total bill per person was $32.19! Soo reasonable and it's even cheaper than some AYCE places.",5 star rating

They are newly renovated, so it made my experience comfortable. The food was delicious and the service was friendly, but at the beginning, 3 different servers came up to us to ask if we were ready to order so coordination can be something to improve on. This location is very busy, so I'd highly suggest dropping by the restaurant first to come put your name down on their waitlist!",4 star rating

The restaurant is in an area that looks like it would be for factories. But the interior inside is elegant and nice, definitely doesn't give the usual hole-in-the-wall Vietnamese restaurant feel. All the food looked really good and I had a hard time choosing. We were able to order our food pretty quickly and didn't have to wait too long.P1. PHỞ NGỌC YẾN ĐẶC BIỆT MEDIUM - 16.75Lots of meat! More meat than there are pho noodles, which is a first. They are also extremely generous with the green onions, too. The meat was good quality and even the meatballs had more flavor and didn't taste like the typical frozen meatballs that I'm used to. The broth was seasoned well (not a lot of meat or bone flavor, though) with lots of spices. I didn't feel like it was overwhelmed with a lot of MSG or anything. By the end, I still had a lot of meat left over despite finishing my noodles already. Definitely worth it, and give the pho a try if you're in the area!CHIA SEEDS DRINK WITH FRESH GRASS JELLY - 6I requested less sugar and it was perfect. The grass jelly was refreshing, perfect for the hot summer day and the chia seeds gave it a nutty and crunchy texture. It's also a pretty healthy drink, and I'd recommend if that's what you're looking for.A couple of my friends got the BÚN BÒ HUẾ and they really enjoyed the spice and flavors. One of them really enjoyed the texture of the noodles.",5 star rating

93,https://www.yelp.ca/biz/pho-ngoc-yen-restaurant-mississauga?osq=Restaurants,Pho Ngoc Yen Restaurant,479 reviews,Marianne B.,I had high expectations of this place given the good recommendations of so many people. Service: I would rate it a 10. The staff was prompt and food came really fast Ambiance: The decor inside was unexpectedly tastefully decorated. I never expected that given the outside industrial area. Food: the plating was nice but the food was forgettable for me. The portions were not much at all given the price point.,4 star rating
94,https://www.yelp.ca/biz/pho-ngoc-yen-restaurant-mississauga?osq=Restaurants,Pho Ngoc Yen Restaurant,479 reviews,Len L.,"Hands down the best Vietnamese food you can eat for the money in the area. Driving to Pho Ngoc was a bit confusing as I did not realize they were in a industrial park. I thought I was in the wrong area and my maps was wrong, I got there before peak hours of 6pm and there were plenty of tables available. The menu was vast and we stuck with the norms. I ordered the bbq pork and chicken with broken rice, 2 bowls of rare beef noodles. Just these 3 items filled us up. I was total surprised there were actual rare beef and not cooked. The waiter gives you the bill and you have to pay at the cashier. They take credit but I recommend cash as you get a discount for cash. As we were walking out, there was a lot of people outside on the lawn waiting to get in. I highly recommend getting there early. Plenty of free parking and bring your appetite.",5 star rating

I've been a customer visiting this restaurant before this diet and I'm so glad I can continue to enjoy it. Don't be spooked by their location (situated randomly in an industrial area), the food here is absolutely amazing - truly a hidden gem. I ordered the vegetarian bun bo hue - super flavourful, tons of toppings, their imitation meat looked so real that I had to double check it was not real meat with their employees + great service + lovely decor",5 star rating

You truly feel like you've walked into a restaurant in Thailand, but then again you're eating in local grandma's kitchen in Chiang Mai.... Brought back some memories for me! Must make a res bc they are busy all the time! but they were able to fit our party of 6 last minute when we were there-- the manager is a miracle worker :)He's super fun and friendly-- even let me try their hot sauce bc I love my food spicy. Try their home-made hot sauce-- it is delicious!! You can buy it for home too. Now for the dishes: You cannot leave here without the pho-- holy cow it's delicious! Their spring rolls are legit. Made with love, light and crispy flakes followed by the stuffing moistened by the fish sauce. The rice dishes are very filling. They're balanced with meat and veggies. Nothing heavy or greasy-- must eat all of the crab cake/egg souffle  cake slice too. Must go and I will def go again!",5 star rating

98,https://www.yelp.ca/biz/pho-ngoc-yen-restaurant-mississauga?osq=Restaurants,Pho Ngoc Yen Restaurant,479 reviews,Lynne C.,"We had a super long layover in Toronto so just opted to grab a hotel room nearby the airport and was STOKED to find such a great Vietnamese restaurant only 15 min walking from where we're staying! We were seated right away thankfully since we hadn't eaten since dinner the day before. We were rushed to sit and given an order slip and menus -- we later learned we were supposed to write down our own orders. After ordering with a staff member, we got two large pho's, the fish sauce chicken wings, and the papaya salad. The pho broth was really delicious, hearty, and the meatballs/beef cuts were very fresh and delicious. The chicken wings could've used a bit of salt and would've been great a bit crispier. The papaya salad tasted just now my mom would make it but the papaya was in thick slices vs thin strips like what is more common. All in all we left very full but pretty irritated. The servers and waitstaff are literally running around like their heads are chopped off which very fair, it was busy but we had to ask for water repeatedly four times (there were tons of workers but seemingly forgetful?) At one point there wasn't a server around for 10 minutes for us to try and flag down. Don't think we'll be back cause we won't be flying through Toronto with this long of a layover but I think we'll try some other local Vietnamese restaurants.",3 star rating

The restaurant is tucked away in the industrial side of Mississauga which makes it a bit harder to get to. It was still quite busy when we got there, just a little before dinner rush. I think we were greeted by the owner, he was very friendly and we were seated right away. The menu is pretty extensive and we ordered the bun bo hue and pho.1) Bun bo hueIt came fairly quickly after placing the order. The portion is pretty big despite what it looks like (the bowl looks small but it was deep). The soup was hot and the flavour was there, however, there was something quite missing compared to other ones I've tried. They were generous with the meat and I really liked the sausage. It was also not as spicy as I expected but it still had a kick to it. 4/52) Pho dac bietThis one came with rare beef, beef balls, and beef shank. Also came right after ordering and was hot. The broth had a nice, clean taste and was packed with meat as well. I think I liked the pho more than the BBH but also have tried other places and found the broth to be a bit lacking in comparison.4.5/5Overall, it's a bit harder to get to this place so I might not go out of my way to try it again but would be willing to eat here if I'm ever around the area.",4 star rating
